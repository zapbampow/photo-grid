# super-simple-photo-grid

This is a very simple responsive photo grid. To look good the images must all have the same aspect ratios. Otherwise, simply change the name at the top, add as many image divs as you want and change the img src addresses.

I originally created this as I worked through Colt Steele's Udemy Bootcamp Course. All the work is my own. But the images in the code are the ones he provided.
